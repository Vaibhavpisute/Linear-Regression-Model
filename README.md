# Linear-Regression-Model
This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict car prices based on various features such as Present Price, Fuel Type, Seller Type, Transmission Type, and more. The goal is to analyze how these factors influence car prices and build a predictive model that estimates the value of a car with reasonable accuracy.
