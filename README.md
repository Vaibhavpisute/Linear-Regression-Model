# Linear-Regression-Model #car prediction model
This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict car prices based on various features such as Present Price, Fuel Type, Seller Type, Transmission Type, and more. The goal is to analyze how these factors influence car prices and build a predictive model that estimates the value of a car with reasonable accuracy.
# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

A simple yet effective machine learning project that predicts used car prices using linear regression. This project includes exploratory data analysis, model building, and a user-friendly desktop GUI using Tkinter for real-time price prediction.

## 📁 Files

- `car_price_pred.py` – Performs data loading, EDA, model training, and evaluation.
- `tinker_based.py` – GUI app to input car details and get price predictions.
- `car_data.csv` – Dataset used (make sure to place this in the same directory or modify the path accordingly).
- Create a directory and placed the dataset,car_pred_model.py,tinker.py in the same directory
